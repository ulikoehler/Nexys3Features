The Nexys3 board contains a four-digit seven segment display.

The SevenSegmentUpdater.vhd file contains the code to set all digits appropriately.
It takes a 32-bit vector as input - the bits 31 downto 24 represents the leftmost
digit of the display. Please refer to the Nexys3 reference manual to see which segments
the bits activate. A segment is active if the corresponding bit is low!

The order of the bits is:

31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24
DP G  F    E   D   C   B   A

The seven segment display is updated with 100 Hz frequency.

The FourDigitCounter.vhd file provides an example of how to use the SevenSegmentUpdater
entity: It counts from 0000 to 9999 with two counts a second.
After the counter has reached 9999, it is started again.
